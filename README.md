# BotosaurOS
The cleverly named discord bot!

This bot is the replacement to boobot. It probably won't be used widely, but in case it is here is what the bot has:

As of right now it has the ability to process basic commands and has a searchable help section. The next big step for the bot
is to add an administrative back end, then later on writing sprint capabilities.

There is a future plan to try to create a scripting interface for simple (or advanced) command creation. This will come once the bot
as been developed and aged a bit so that the bot is more reliable with more testing under it's belt.

This bot was written in python 3.5 on Linux. It should run anywhere else as long as discord.py is installed and the bot is run in
Python 3.5. Asyncio is also required for it to work.
